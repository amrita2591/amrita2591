Hi
I have performed selection pressure analysis (aBSREL analysis using nucleotide sequences) on extracellular and intracellular domains of a transmembrane receptor of fishes (Figure 1B, C). Strangely, even the fishes belonging to same order are not cladding together, for example, Channa punctata (order: Anabantiformes) is not cladding with Channa striata but with Cynoglossus semilaevis (order: Pleuronectiformes) and Hippocampus erectus (order: Syngnathiformes) (Figure 1B, C). Nevertheless, when a phylogenetic tree was generated using MEGA software, Channa punctata cladded with Channa striata (Figure 1A). I have found the evidence of recombination (GARD analysis on extracellular (http://datamonkey.org/gard/621b6e124040572c69c68983) and intracellular nucleotide sequences of the receptor. Can you please suggest the possible reason for this discrepant observation that fishes of even the same order are not grouping together in the trees of aBSREL analysis?![Figure](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101322026/157627341-dc16f0af-2ad3-4a50-9168-61b511555d95.jpg)
